# Scratch-Ye-Heads !!!

Programming forcing to Scratch your Heads.....

No worries we got you covered. In this event we will be learning `"extremely beginner friendly"` programmming while developing
mini-games.

What you waiting for now ?!.... Start Scratching !!!

## Setting Up the Environment ( Estimated Time : 5 mins )
- Create an account on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)
- Verify your email
- All further tasks will be held on this platform for this contest

## Basics of Scratch ( Estimated Time : 5 mins )
- Checkout the Panels Labelled : `Code`, `Costumes` and `Sound` 
- While the `Code` panel is selected you can look into various differently labelled code blocks on the left : `Motion` , `Sensing` , `Control` etc
- Drag and Drop Blocks of code to set up your logic
- The stage where the output will be shown is already set up and the characters are implemented.
- Just think of the logic and drag-n-drop blocks and progress.

## Output Format:
- Make a word file locally and save as `Scratch`
- Make Sure you save the project as sharable. Click on `Share` at the top to make the project sharable.
- Copy link of the project and save it in the word file with Task1/ Task2/ Task3/ BonusTask as the heading.


## Task 1 : Place the Glasses (Estimated Time: 30m mins) 
 
 `Are you a good bartender ?`

### Objective
- Place the glasses in the given pattern to solve this task

### Project Setup:
- Open this [link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1066889149) IN A NEW TAB and click on `Remix`

### Hints and Clues:
- For pattern generation you can refer to the following website: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/programs-printing-pyramid-patterns-python/
- New Variables can be made by going to Variables option on the left
- Some variables are already created for you. Try creating some more variables to solve the task

## Task 2 : Triangular Geometries (Estimated Time: 30 mins)

`A starry sky hides a geometrical challenge! Your task is to create a mesmerizing pattern of triangles within triangles, with each triangle aligned precisely.`

### Objective
- Make the pool balls generate in the given pattern to solve this task

### Project Setup:

- Open this [link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1064843591) IN A NEW TAB and click on `Remix`

### Hints and Clues:
- Use the Pen extension (lower left corner of your screen) to draw the triangles.
- You can Make your own block by going to the my block option, to avoid repetition of codes.
- The length of each side can dynamically decrease as you nest triangles.
- Make sure to correctly manage the size and pen color for each triangle to create a visually appealingÂ pattern.

## Task 3 : Guide the Toad (estimated time 35 min.) 


`I write my name with a no. 9915 in all the handles, and no one knows why. But I don't do things without any reason. I had placed the ships on some coordinates. Can you find any relation between the ships coordinates?`


### Objective  
- You have to find the patterns in the coordinates of the ships and make the toad to only move to those coordinates. 
- Trick is you can not make toad to directly go to the coordinates. 
- Your code blocks should consist the logic of moving the toad using some mathematics ðŸ˜Ž. 


### Project Setup:
- Open this [link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1067720500) IN A NEW TAB and click on `Remix`

### Hints and Clues:

-  See the coordinates of all ships carefully 

- Apply the repeat until and if then blocks 

- I had already made the variables for you ( thanks me later ðŸ˜Š ) 

- See the coordinates of the ships on clicking their sprites in the sprites list and try to find a patternÂ inÂ them.

## Task 4 : Brick Breaker ( Estimated Time : 45 mins )

`Bounce, Smash and Win!`

### Objective  
- Break all the bricks by bouncing a ball off a paddle while avoiding losing the ball, achieving the highestÂ scoreÂ possible

### Project Setup:
- Open this [link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1067142869) IN A NEW TAB and click on `Remix`

### Hints and Clues:
- Ball Mechanics: Implement ball movement, including collision detection with walls and paddle, ensuring proper reflection.
- Brick Breaking and Scoring: Write code for detecting ball collisions with bricks, breaking them, and updating the score.
- Game Over Screen: Display a "Game Over" screen when lives run out, with options to restart or exit the game.
- You Win Screen: Show a "You Win" screen when all bricks are broken, with options toÂ replayÂ orÂ exit.
